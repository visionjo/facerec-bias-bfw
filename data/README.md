### Balanced Faces _in the Wild_ (BFW)

BFW, proposed in [<span style="color:blue">**1**</span>], provides balance in data (i.e., different subgroups) for face verification. Specifically, Table I compares BFW to related datasets (i.e., bias in faces), Table II characterizes BFW highlighting relevant stats, and Figure 1 shows a sample montage for each of the eight subgroups in BFW.

**Subgroups of BFW.** Each row depicts a different gender, Female (F) (top) and Male (M) (bottom). Columns are grouped by ethnicity (i.e., Asian (A), Black (B), Indian (I), and White (W), respectfully).
